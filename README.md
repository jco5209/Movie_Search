## Build a movie search app with the OMDb API and AJAX

*Project 5 of Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript course*

###Project objectives:

* Use JavaScript, jQuery and AJAX to load JSON data from a server via a GET HTTP request.

* Given basic HTML/CSS, program the search form to return movie data in JSON format based on the form submission.
* Use the API data to dynamically create HTML displaying a movie's title, year of release, and poster image.
* Display a placeholder icon when the API does not return poster data.
* Let users know when search returns no movie data.

*For extra credit, link a movie to its IMDb page, and allow a user to filter the search by year of release.*
